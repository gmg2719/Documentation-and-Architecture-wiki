### Notes
* Discussion which specifications to link on https://github.com/5G-MAG/Documentation-and-Architecture/projects .
  * Decided to link the ones that were used for implementation
  * Thorsten: Might be good to link 26348, currently only xMB stage 3 is linked
  * See: https://member.5g-mag.com/wg/TF-RT/wiki/48
* Discussion on the architecture illustrations
  * Separate illustration for 5G MS, 5G BC and hybrid approach
  * Consider splitting the diagrams up 
* Discussion if changes to the players (dash.js, hls.js) are required, especially for low latency
  * Ideally no changes to the player. Handling should be done in application
* 5GMS Client can use MBMS-API
* Next call on October 8th. Focus on
