The *Application Process* is not a process itself. It is a placeholder for the 5G broadcast community to setup their current and future (OTT) applications on top of the receiver and gateway. Applications might include use cases like seamless streaming, targeted-ads, further investigation of content protection solutions with and without available broadband and 5G BC.

> **Status**: For simple testing purposes, the [Gateway process](https://github.com/5G-MAG/obeca-gateway-process) includes an RTP player and an HLS/DASH player hosted on OBECA, and enables standalone use-cases (mobiles, STB).
